It's a try of writing a simple vue js game.

## RoadMap

Basic things what should be in project:

- [:x:] FullTypescript;
- [:x:] FullTestCoverage.

This is exactly what I want to code:

- [:heavy_check_mark:] MainMenu;
- [:x:] CardsUI;
- [:x:] CardsTypes: \[DD, Healer\];
- [:x:] CardsActions: \[Spawn, Heal, TakeDamage, Attack, Die\];
- [:x:] SimpleEnemyAi;
- [:x:] Fights.

This is what I would like to try to code:

- [:x:] CardsType: \[Resurrector\];
- [:x:] CardsAction: \[Resurrect\];
- [:x:] WebSocketMultiplayerGames;
- [:x:] GoodUI.

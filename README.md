# card_fighters
It's a try of writing a simple vue js game.

## RoadMap

Basic things what should be in project:

- [:x:] FullTypescript;
- [:x:] FullTestCoverage.

This is exactly what I want to code:

- [:heavy_check_mark:] MainMenu;
- [:heavy_check_mark:] CardsUI \[Card, Action, Graveyard\];
- [:heavy_check_mark:] CardsTypes: \[DD, Healer\];
- [:heavy_check_mark:] CardsActions: \[Spawn, Heal, TakeDamage, Attack, Die\];
- [:x:] SimpleEnemyAi;
- [:x:] Fights.

This is what I would like to try to code:

- [:x:] CardsType: \[Resurrector\];
- [:x:] CardsAction: \[Resurrect\];
- [:x:] WebSocketMultiplayerGames;
- [:x:] GoodUI.

## Retrospective

This section is designed to evaluate the development, identify the good and bad sides.

Good things:

- [:heavy_plus_sign:] ts;

Bad things:

- [:heavy_minus_sign:] naming;
